## What You Can Expect from Mendix Support

Although our platform is highly accessible and new versions of our products are tested extensively before going live, we want to provide the assurance that we are available in the case of disruptions.

Mendix Support is here to answer any questions and solve any issues that you might have. We try to make your journey as frictionless as possible.

### Service Level Agreements

We are there for all users of the Mendix platform, and we are bound by a service-level agreement (SLA) to our licensed customers. Licensed customers can select their type of SLA level: Platform or Platinum. The SLA level determines the specific agreement on the following points: 
* Support availability 
* Platform availability 
* Maintenance 
* Incident response time
* Incident resolution time 
* Recovery time objective (RTO)
* Recovery point objective (RPO)

The SLA for your company is available upon request. Please contact [Mendix Support](https://support.mendix.com/hc/en-us) or your Customer Success Manager if you want to check the details. 

## Finding Your Answers

We expect that many questions and issues can and will be solved by reading the Mendix [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com) and [forum](https://forum.mendix.com). If you canâ€™t find your answer there, you can submit a question, incident, or change request with Mendix Support. We will act as focal point for issues on the Mendix Modeler, your applications, the [Cloud Portal](https://cloud.mendix.com), and the [Platform Portal](https://home.mendix.com). We will forward the issue to the second and third line if necessary.

## Feature Requests

We would like to invite you to an important channel where you can provide feature requests to Mendix: the [Mendix Idea Forum](https://forum.mendix.com/link/ideas/). Every quarter, any customer can post a feature request, which can be reviewed, expanded on, and voted on by other members of the Mendix Community. Based on this feedback, we will determine which features have the most value according to our customers, and they will be implemented.

## Accessing Mendix Support

You can access our Mendix Support team through the [Support Portal](https://support.mendix.com), via email (<support@mendix.com>), or by phone (the phone numbers are listed in the Support Portal). Please note that critical tickets always need to be accompanied by a phone call to speed up the triage of the issue. You can check the status of your personal tickets and all submitted tickets on your applications and provide updates on them in the Support Portal.

## What We Expect from You

Mendix supports the Mendix platform, and we expect you to support the applications that you have built on the platform. The following points are not supported through the standard SLA:
* Developing code on your behalf
* Debugging or troubleshooting your applications
* Analyzing and troubleshooting the performance of your applications or your infrastructure, except when we suspect an underlying issue exists in the Mendix platform
* Troubleshooting Mendix Community-developed components from the Mendix App Store

During the start phase and through part of the scale phase of your digital transformation journey, it might be best to let the Development Team handle the support of the applications (DevOps). As the number of applications grows, it is best to let an Expert Service desk handle the support of your applications. You can involve your existing service desk team or outsource support to one of our support partners, which you can find on the [Mendix Partners](https://developer.mendixcloud.com/openid/login?immediate=true&continuation=link/partneroverview) page.

## Company admins

To manage your company account and the users, projects, and licensed cloud nodes of your company, you can appoint company admins in our Platform Portal. 

## Technical Contacts

You need to appoint a technical contact for each of your applications. The technical contact can check the performance of the applications in the Cloud Portal and receives alerts from our Cloud Portal based on errors and warnings in each application. It is possible to make other team members receive these alerts as well. 
It is very important to read these alerts carefully and act upon them, as they can influence the performance of your app. For more information on the alerts, see the [monitoring application health documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/mendixcloud/monitoring-application-health).

## Training

We expect your support team to be trained and certified on the Mendix Modeler, the Platform Portal, and our Cloud Portal, so that they can interpret and analyze alerts, graphs, and logs in the Cloud Portal. Please check out our [offering](https://developers.mendix.com/training/) for available training courses and webinars, or contact the Academy for more information. 

## Reach out to Mendix Support

If, after your analysis, an issue in the Mendix Platform is suspected, or if you have questions about your analysis, you can reach out to Mendix Support. We will provide pointers on how to solve the issues yourself or redirect you to Expert Services for further assistance. If we suspect a platform issue, we will involve second and third line support for confirmation, and fix it if it is a platform issue. If the issue is commercial, for example, because your app requires a larger app container or more file storage, you might refer you to your customer success manager directly. 

## Platform status

If there is an issue in the Mendix Platform that affects multiple customers, or if there is planned maintenance, we will communicate this through our [status page](https://status.mendix.com) and send updates on the progress through email if you have subscribed to this service. It is recommended to have your service desk team subscribe to updates from this page. 

## Product Support Period

Mendix supports the current major release and two prior major releases, and we support major releases for a minimum of 24 months. Because of this, we recommend that you upgrade your projects to the latest version of the Mendix Modeler at least once a year. We will reach out to you in time if you are running on a version that will become unsupported, so that you have ample time to perform an upgrade.
